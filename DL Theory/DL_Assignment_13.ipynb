        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Backpropagation is a supervised learning algorithm for training neural networks that use gradient descent optimization. The goal of backpropagation is to adjust the weights and biases of the network to minimize the difference between its predicted output and the actual output. Backpropagation works by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias in the network, and then updating them in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the loss. This process is repeated iteratively until the network's performance is satisfactory.\n",
        "\n",
        "The backpropagation algorithm works in two phases:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Forward pass: During the forward pass, the input is propagated through the neural network, layer by layer, to compute the output. At each layer, the output is computed as the weighted sum of the input, followed by the application of a non-linear activation function. The output of the final layer is compared to the true output to compute the loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Backward pass: During the backward pass, the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias is computed using the chain rule of differentiation. The gradients are then used to update the weights and biases in the opposite direction of the gradient, with the learning rate controlling the step size of the update.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reverse-mode autodiff, also known as backpropagation through time, is a more general algorithm for computing gradients in computational graphs. It is used not only in neural networks but in a wide variety of machine learning algorithms. The main difference between backpropagation and reverse-mode autodiff is that backpropagation is a specific implementation of reverse-mode autodiff for neural networks. Reverse-mode autodiff works by decomposing the computation graph of a function into a sequence of elementary operations and then computing the gradients of the output with respect to the inputs by recursively applying the chain rule of differentiation from the output to the inputs. This algorithm is very efficient for computing gradients for functions with a large number of inputs and a small number of outputs, which is common in neural networks. In contrast, the standard numerical method of computing the gradients using finite differences becomes computationally infeasible when the number of inputs is large."
